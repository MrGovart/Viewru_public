# Viewru_public

WARNING! IT'S NSFW STUFF!

A friend of mine said that it would be cool to create a free alternative to scroller.com that will combine reddit and booru imageboards.

Viewru can browse rule34.xxx (use index.html from r34 folder). It has some kind of responsive design, handy image modals, handmaded autocomplete.
You can hit the 'Gen URL' button to save your filters in query so you can bookmark the page and check it later.
Essentially, with little effort you can make it work with any booru imageboard.

Viewru can browse reddit the same way, but it isn't completed and there is no frontend and it's published as my personal script on reddit (their security things),
so you can't literally use it.

You can host viewru.
There is some routing, web-scrapper for reddit... and that's actually all.
